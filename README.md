# File Management README
This directory is structured as follows: (1) Data, (2) Scripts, (3) Literature, (4) Documents, and (5) Deliverables (Figure 1).

## Data Folder
The data folder is for spatial and tabular data. It is divided into source files – those which we collect – and processed files – those which we produce/derive (Figure 2).

There is also a metadata Excel spreadsheet that tracks the location of files within the directory.

## Scripts Folder
The scripts folder is for code scripts (e.g., Python), tools (e.g., Excel models), or project files (e.g., .APRX) used for generating or processing data (Figure 3).

## Literature Folder
The literature folder is for organizing external articles, reports, and other documents. This folder is different from the documents folder in that its contents are not produced by the project team.

## Documents Folder
The documents folder is for all documents generated for or by the project team, not including deliverables. I recommend subfolders for meeting notes, important correspondences (e.g., memoranda and important emails), action items (e.g., work assignments), and other similar documents. Below is a visual example of what this could look like (Figure 4).

File naming conventions are important. I generally recommend including dates in front of document names – formatted YYYY-MM-DD – so that an alphabetical sort results in a chronological sort. This naming convention makes more sense in some places and less sense in others. It is ideal for organizing meeting minutes and memoranda, but it might be confusing if used on a shared working document. To reduce confusion on shared documents, you could use a non-dated file (e.g., FileName.docx) as the active working document but then make a copy every week or so that you archive (e.g., 20230906_FileName.docx).

## Deliverables Folder
The deliverables folder is for draft and completed versions of project deliverables.
